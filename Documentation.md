# NariCareAI – Project Documentation
## AI-Powered Early PCOS Risk Screening Platform

---

# 1. Introduction

NariCareAI is an AI-driven healthcare platform designed to assist women in **early screening and preventive management of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)**.

The platform combines **machine learning, explainable AI, and preventive health recommendations** to help women identify possible risk factors associated with PCOS and receive lifestyle guidance for better health management.

The system is built using **Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)** technologies to ensure accessibility, transparency, and community collaboration.

NariCareAI is designed as a **screening and awareness tool**, helping women take proactive steps toward better health.

---

# 2. Problem Statement

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common hormonal disorders affecting women of reproductive age.

Studies suggest that **approximately 1 in 5 women may suffer from PCOS**, yet a large number of cases remain **undiagnosed for years**.

### Key Challenges

**Delayed Diagnosis**
Many women ignore early symptoms such as irregular menstrual cycles, acne, or sudden weight gain.

**Limited Access to Screening Tools**
Diagnosis typically requires blood tests or ultrasound scans, which may not be easily accessible.

**Low Awareness**
Women often become aware of PCOS only after severe symptoms develop.

**Existing Applications Focus on Tracking**
Most apps only track menstrual cycles but do not provide **AI-driven early risk prediction or explainable insights.**

---

# 3. Proposed Solution

NariCareAI addresses these challenges by providing an **AI-powered risk screening platform** that analyzes health and lifestyle indicators to estimate the likelihood of PCOS.

The platform provides users with:

• A **PCOS risk score** based on machine learning analysis  
• **Explainable insights** showing contributing health factors  
• **Preventive lifestyle recommendations**

The goal is to support **early awareness and preventive health management**, not replace professional medical diagnosis.

##### Currently working on...
## Doctor's teleconsultation improved. 
Doctor's can get a key to nter user profile and see their whole histry report.
after teleconsultation user can read the whole communication summary - in patient language.


## PCOS centric periods time periods prediction.
Cllecting data from pcos patient of their cycles to create dataset and then train model to help detect/predict their next periods cycle time-range based on their history of last 3-4 cycles (~6months).
---

# 9. Future Integrations
The platform can be expanded with additional features in future versions.
## Mobile Application
Develop Android and iOS versions for greater accessibility.

## Wearable Device Integration
Integrate with fitness trackers to monitor:

• Sleep patterns  
• Heart rate  

## Research Data Contribution
Allow users to share anonymized health data to support future research and better AI models.

## AI Health Assistant
An AI chatbot could help answer women's health questions and provide guidance.
---

# 10. Disclaimer
NariCareAI is intended for **educational and preliminary screening purposes only**.
It **does not provide medical diagnosis** and should not replace consultation with qualified healthcare professionals.
Users experiencing symptoms or health concerns should consult a licensed medical practitioner.
---

# Conclusion
NariCareAI demonstrates how **machine learning, open-source technologies, and preventive healthcare approaches** can be combined to support women's health awareness.
