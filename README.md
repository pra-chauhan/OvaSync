# 🌸 NariCareAI – AI Powered Early PCOS Risk Screening Platform

NariCareAI is an **AI-driven early PCOS risk screening platform** designed to help women detect potential Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) risks and take preventive action through lifestyle guidance.

The project aims to improve **women's health awareness, early screening, and preventive care** using machine learning and open-source technologies.

---

# 🚨 Problem

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) affects **nearly 1 in 5 women worldwide**, yet many cases remain **undiagnosed for years**.

Common challenges include:

- Lack of awareness about early symptoms
- Delayed diagnosis due to expensive medical tests
- Limited access to preventive health tools
- Existing applications mostly focus on **period tracking rather than early AI-based risk screening**

Early detection and lifestyle intervention can significantly improve long-term health outcomes.

---

# 💡 Solution

**NariCareAI** provides an **AI-powered screening system** that allows women to assess their potential PCOS risk and receive actionable lifestyle recommendations.

The platform analyzes health indicators and symptoms using **machine learning models** to generate a **PCOS risk score**, explain the factors influencing the prediction, and provide preventive health insights.

# ✨ Key Features

- 🔍 **AI-Based PCOS Risk Prediction**  
  Predicts the likelihood of PCOS using machine learning models.

- 🧠 **Dual Screening System**  
  - Basic screening using lifestyle and symptom inputs  
  - Advanced screening using clinical indicators

- 📊 **Explainable AI Insights**  
  SHAP analysis explains the factors contributing to prediction results.

- **Diet Generation**
  Based on the health output of the user. LLM based diet generation by considering pcos friendly foods.

- 🩺**Doctor Consultation** - telecommunication.
  User can show the report to doctor so far they have done on the app and doctor can read that.

- 🩺 **Health Dashboard**  
  Displays risk scores, contributing health factors, and health indicators.

- 🧘 **Lifestyle Recommendations**  
  Personalized suggestions including diet, exercise, yoga, and preventive health practices.
